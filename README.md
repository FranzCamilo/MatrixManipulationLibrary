# MatrixManipulationLibrary
C++ library for matrix manipulation and linear algebra methods.

This is the 1st version for my matrix manipulation software.
This project contains a "main" function with a menu for the main available matrix operations
(matrix multiplication and linear equation system solving) with all needed instructions.
However, there are many other internal and interesting functions also available in this repository.
Among them, the function "testLinearEqSystemSolving" needs all the text files compressed in the LinearTestCases.zip.
